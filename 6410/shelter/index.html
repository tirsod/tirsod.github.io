            <p><strong>where am i?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>you’re in one of our shelters.</strong> a corner of reality that cannot be accessed by [REDACTED] through conventional methods. we are always relocating to avoid detection.</p>
    
            <p><strong>who are you?</strong></p>
    
            <p>6410 is an inter-layer archival project dedicated to the study, research, and containment of the works of “tirsod”.</p>
    
            <p><strong>who is tirsod?</strong></p>
    
            <p>we know “tirsod” to be a “system” or “intelligence” that manifests in the form of many things, all of them at once. it usually resembles a solo creative and often uploads works to the internet in the form of:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>games</li>
                <li>music</li>
                <li>and art</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>which are essential to name to achieve containment.</p>
            <p>there are some extra areas it seems to display some degree of expertise on, but that don’t seem as important or “charged” with its consciousness as these three main groups of work.</p>

            <p><strong>what does tirsod stand for?</strong></p>
    
            <p></p>we’re not entirely sure what “tirsod” means or stands for. we believe “tirsod” stands for<br><div id="tirname" style="display: inline; font-size: .9em; min-height: 100px; max-height: 100px;">tiered inter-layer relay series of dimensioners</div>...</p>
            <p>however, our attempts at making acronyms out of this name tend to be very volatile and switch up before we can write them down.</p>
    
            <p><strong>is tirsod human?</strong></p>
    
            <p>it seems likely that “tirsod” was, at some point, human. it responds to a very specific set of names, like [CLASSIFIED] and [CLASSIFIED], male pronouns, and comments on historical events that happened years ago in the real world. however, it is uncertain whether “tirsod” is <em>still</em> human, or if he’s operating entirely within a digital context.</p>
    
            <p><strong>what do you know about tirsod?</strong></p>
    
            <p>“tirsod” is a key suspect in an ongoing case of alternate realities surrounding our world, including the recently spotted “dream layer”. it is unclear what his methods are or what his goals are.</p>

            <p>concerningly, we have detailed a couple of behaviors around the “tirsod” entity that makes us believe that it is on a path to become something… far beyond our comprehension.</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>It keeps evolving</li>
                <li>It resists containment</li>
                <li>It keeps creating realities</li>
                <li>It wants to escape.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p><strong>how do you know it’s tirsod?</strong></p>
    
            <p>we’ve discovered a couple of elements that remain consistent across these dimensions. there’s three (known) common components to these realities:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>the presence of an “avatar”. usually a blue hoodied man, with long, curly black hair, attempting to spread a new type of ideology.</li>
                <li>a cat companion. usually a passive contributor, though it has been showcasing a stronger presence in recent iterations, designed to humanize him.</li>
                <li>a world-ending threat of unknown shape or form.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>we must reiterate. it is <strong>dangerous</strong> to exist in these worlds. if you find yourself lost, look for our safety code near an exit and evacuate from the location at your earliest convenience.</p>
    
            <p><strong>what is the safety code?</strong></p>
    
            <p>the safety code is the same one as our organization name.</p>
    
            <p>6410.</p>
    
            <p>look for a TV broadcast.</p>
    
            <p>6410tv.</p>
    
            <p>if the memory or existence of 6410tv has been REMOVED from <em>your</em> version of reality, look for it in other places.</p>
    
            <p>look for the number wherever it seems unusual. etched on a wall, written on a sign, labeled on a branded piece of merchandise.</p>
    
            <p>if you see this code in a repeated manner, you need to get out. ASAP. look for the nearest exit and run through it.</p>

            <p>someone will come pick you up.</p>
    
            <p><strong>what’s going to happen to my reality?</strong></p>
    
            <p>if you haven’t seen the 6410 code around you, it most likely means you are SAFE. we will continue our methods, achieving containment of the instance of “tirsod” that exists in your reality.</p>
    
            <p><strong>how are you containing tirsod?</strong></p>
    
            <p>thanks to our research we’ve learned a great deal about “tirsod” and have consistently found that the best way to avoid its spread is making it <em>believe</em> it has been successful in doing so. you’ve most likely found this shelter by hopping through one of our fabricated “tirsod” websites where we catalogue his works. we are constantly going through these works and assessing how much of it can be <em>safely perceived by the public</em>, often painstakingly reverse engineering them to fabricate a perfect “replica” that will deceive him. this is just <em>one</em> of our containment methods.</p>
    
            <p><strong>what is a delusion?</strong></p>
    
            <p>a delusion is a front. a website, an article, a text message, a news broadcast, a phone call. a delusion is a means to convey to “tirsod” that his works are being perceived by the public. these keep the spread at bay and give us time to prepare for the next wave of works. the higher the level of the delusion, the more careful we have to be with its contents.</p>
    
            <p><strong>did i hear you talk to me before?</strong></p>
    
            <p><strong>there is an unknown third party collaborating with “tirsod”.</strong> we do NOT know what it is. we do not UNDERSTAND what it is. but we know it has access to our records of events in distant realities and is using it to aid him in achieving his goal.</p>
    
            <p>if you are reached out to by a metallic, raspy sounding voice, do NOT listen to it. choose to IGNORE IT, and head for the nearest television box. tune into a nonexistent channel. if necessary, CUT any cables other than the power or remove the antenna. the noisy signal will keep it away.</p>
    
            <p>we will NEVER reach out to you through voice recordings. our communications will always be in plain-text english. if you hear a voice claiming to be 6410, it is NOT us.</p>
    
            <p><strong>remember.</strong></p>
    
            <a href="https://tirsod.com"><p>stick to the noise, and remain static.</p></a>
        
            <p>we will be back with you after these messsages.</p>
