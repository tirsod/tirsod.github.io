            <div id="postContent" style="max-width: 90%">
          <p>About two decades ago, in a time none of us feel comfortable calling “retro” a little portable device for entertainment was born. Residing then on the hands of millions of people who didn't know how attached they could become to a pixelated dog, was the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>What I saw on the playground - the backyard of the school I went to until I turned 10 - was out of this world.</p>
<p>A game controller with two screens you could play games on.</p>
<p>Up until this day, my only concept of gaming was sorting through discs on my playstation and playing flash games on the computer. And my only reference point for portable game would have been one of those 99 in 1 brick games, or whatever version of snake my grandfather had on his phone.</p>
<p>That was all flipped on its head that day…</p>
<p>A kid was playing New Super Mario Bros.</p>
<p>It was the snowball minigame.</p>
<p>You drag the snowball with a stylus.</p>
<p>Oh. Wait.</p>
<p>This thing has a touchscreen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I vividly remember the ride back home from school that day. The way I desperately explained the ins and outs of the Nintendo DS to my parents.</p>
<p>We take it for granted today, but the Nintendo DS was way more than just a game console. It was a promise for the future. What once seemed like a feature only for the types of people to wear suits, carry suitcases and take phone calls in the busy streets of a bustling city, was now a reality for average people like you and me.</p>
<p>PDAs were another obsession of mine. And it was all for the same reason:</p>
<p>You can touch the screen.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone could have foreseen a future where we'd be asking to put buttons back in our car’s dashboards because touchscreens would slowly become a <em>cheap “luxury” that just made it harder to turn on the AC.</em></p>
<p>But this? At this time?</p>
<p>It was the future.</p>
<p>The events that took place that one fateful birthday probably changed my life forever.</p>
<p>Fresh off the display cabinet of the Hobby 2000 toy shop, a Nintendo DS Lite, and a copy of Pokemon Pearl. And I gotta say,</p>
<p>I probably didn’t know at all what was happening,</p>
<p>But I was having fun.</p>
<p>I was playing on a DS.</p>
<hr>
<p>Time passed.</p>
<p>Holidays happened.</p>
<p>Birthdays celebrated.</p>
<p>Some kids graduated.</p>
<p>I was thinking about a console I’d make when I grow up. Like a DS inside some glasses, with screens in front of your head.</p>
<p>I got more games,</p>
<p>I got accessories,</p>
<p>I got a SuperCard,</p>
<p>I got a laptop,</p>
<p>The DS was synonymous with me. I carried it everywhere. It was like my best friend.</p>
<p>I learned about roms,</p>
<p>I learned about emulation,</p>
<p>I learned about homebrew,</p>
<p>I learned about the scene.</p>
<p>It was chaos all the time. Whatever games I saw on the magazine I’d get and drop after a week. Scribblenauts got a lot of playtime out of me.</p>
<p>Then I dropped it a couple of times.</p>
<p>Then it stopped reading games so well.</p>
<p>Then the games got a little boring.</p>
<p>Then newer consoles were more exciting.</p>
<p>I missed out on the DSI, and I didn’t get a 3DS until 2025. The 2DS was my weapon of choice for 2017, but the Switch was already out by then.</p>
<p>And then the smartphones arrived.</p>
<p>And then indie games blew up.</p>
<p>And then PC was more my thing.</p>
<p>And then the PS3 came to play.</p>
<p>And as time and technology progressed, the “new” on that game’s case wasn’t so “new” anymore. What once was groundbreaking had nothing more to show, because at that point my phone had as many games and more, and they ALL supported touch.</p>
<hr>
<p>Time passes. Things get old. Friends leave. Trends die.</p>
<p>It’s inevitable, and you can’t help but wish you could shortly go back.</p>
<p>But it could never be the same.</p>
<p>You can’t undo what years of advancements will do to your brain.</p>
<p>The magic that it once captured is nostalgic, but clunky and outdated.</p>
<p>Practically any device now can emulate what the DS once offered. It is no longer a necessity.</p>
<p>Its makers agree.</p>
<p>They don’t sell the thing anymore.</p>
<p>It’s been phased out by what’s fresh and new.</p>
<p>The Wii. The 3DS. The Wii U. The Switch.</p>
<p>The Switch 2.</p>
<p>And eventually, that will also get old, and phased out by the new.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>My Nintendo DS died today,</p>
<p>but to be completely frank,</p>
<p>it had been dead for a decade.</p>
<p>It’s been years of collecting dust… of being tucked away in a drawer… And today, during an ironic act of nostalgic necromancy,</p>
<p>it finally went away.</p>
<p>It won’t power on again,</p>
<p>but that doesn’t matter, because It wasn’t powering on anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s impossible for me to put in words just how weird it feels, to have something that feels like a “fact of life” just wither away. It was my mistake, yes. but it’s also just the way things work.</p>
<p>So many things have come and gone. So many other things have since replaced that DS and robbed me of so many more hours it could have ever aspired to have stolen.</p>
<p>But it is insane to me that such an iconic piece of history could just… go away like that. Forgotten.</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>The DS still lives on in everybody’s hearts.</p>
<p>I probably wasn’t the only one to take it on every single road trip, every family gathering, every gone out shopping. I know many people understand that feeling of enjoying something revolutionary yet, at the same time, so simple.</p>
<p>I’m really glad for what it allowed technology to become,</p>
<p>I’m really glad for how it showed people what could be done,</p>
<p>I’m really glad for the memories and joy it brought me endlessly,</p>
<p>and I’m really glad for how it continues to unite a generation of people who just really wanted a dog.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>I can’t waste my time wishing I could forget everything and experience it all again.</p>
<p>That’d be a disservice to what the DS taught me to expect of humanity.</p>
<p>Instead, I will hope that something else will capture that feeling of magic once again.</p>
<p>Because with so many exciting things awaiting in the future,</p>
<p>What’s better than focusing on the present until they come?</p>
<hr>
<h2>A final note:</h2>
<p>If you have one of these old pieces of hardware that you’re sentimental about… Either don’t touch it, or have it looked at by someone who knows what they’re doing.</p>
<p>A lot of them are ticking time bombs just waiting for the right time to stop working.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t get too attached. But I can’t help it. Even if I didn’t play with it anymore… We go way back.</p>
<p>It’s fine, though. Objects are replaceable. Memories are irreplaceable.</p>
<p>So yeah, go make more memories. Stop standing around doing nothing. Doesn’t matter what it is. If I have to make a recommendation, though? Check in on your family. Probably way better than grinding some ranked mode away.</p>
<p>Enjoy what you have and don’t stress so much about the small details.
12/5/25</p>
<p>Small update.
It's alive.
I'd rather have my battle scarred DS than throw it in the trash.</p>
