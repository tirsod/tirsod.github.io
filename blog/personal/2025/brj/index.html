          <p>Well that was fun :)</p>
<p>Ah, January came and went in the blink of an eye. Are we sure it didn't, just, speed up?</p>
<p>Here's the story.</p>
<p>I was invited by a friend to join their team. I've always been reluctant to join these competitions because I'm not very good at time management when it comes to these things.</p>
<p>Or more accurately, I'm not very confident that I can commit to such projects with <em>that</em> tight of a deadline. It doesn't feel right to start something I won't finish, because I've started way too many things already.</p>
<p>But, the prospect was different this time. There was a team, I was mostly making assets and we had a whole month to work with.</p>
<p>Cool! I can get behind this!</p>
<p>The theme is revealed and we're supposed to make a game with spinning in it. Awesome! Let's make an action game and put the characters on a spinning vinyl.</p>
<p>We have a musical sub-theme now, so every boss will have its own musical genre and design. Everyone designs their bosses and... I still have no clue what mine is gonna look like.</p>
<p>I figured I'd make drum and bass because I was listening to some music like it earlier and I already knew how to make it so- That's settled. Maybe he will be a drummer that attacks you with hi-hats and sticks?</p>
<p>But by the time the characters were getting animated I still didn't have a design... By some miracle, I came up with the idea to make a DJ boss. I sketch it up, design the boss fight, and post it in our group chat.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a trap.</p>
<p>One of the reference images I used to draw the boss, was a screenshot of the VirtualDJ software.</p>
<p>&quot;VirtualDJ... I've been here before...&quot;</p>
<p>For practically half a month, all I did was watch DJ videos, make my own mixes, research hardware and learn about the history of DJing from an MIT class on YouTube.</p>
<p>Man,</p>
<p>I could make the best DJ boss fight ever now!</p>
<p>One small problem, though.
7 days remain and my boss still has no presence in the game.</p>
<p>... oops...</p>
<p>During that time we all put our hands together and crunched like we haven't before.
We had to try.
We MIGHT be able to pull this off.
I made my boss' 3D model, animated it, put it in the game, set up the stage, did some basic attacks and had a good time with friends struggling together.</p>
<p>We didn't make it to the deadline... and our game is still unplayable. But... Do I regret it?</p>
<p>Not at all.
I learned a lot. And it's not like your work magically vanishes at the end of the day.</p>
<p>A lot of it remains, still. All my music is there. My design is there. It led me into trying out a fun new hobby and gave me a new perspective on many things.</p>
<p>Would you miss out on that... by being afraid of failure?</p>
