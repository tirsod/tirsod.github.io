  <h1>this is just the same post, but using the template for the subpages, unedited!</h1>
<p>(This post is, more than a very technical behind the scenes, a quick timeline/recap this website's history up until this point. Why? Because <strong>that</strong> just now? was the longest week of my life.)</p>
<p>Ah. That feels good.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a week after I started, I have finished the painstaking work of porting over my entire website to this new system.</p>
<p>Let's talk about that. But first, let us start…</p>
<h1>At the beginning</h1>
<hr>
<p>Making a website is easy, it just requires practice. Practice that I didn't necessarily <em>neglect</em> but definitely put off for a long while.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cM22euX.png" alt="td1"></p>
<p>I mean, look.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fdo3L1g.png" alt="td2"></p>
<p>As a kid, I've always, always! wanted a website to myself. I've made multiple with site creation tools like blogspot, wix or jimdo.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8cBwU2k.png" alt="pg"></p>
<p>The issue with most website creation tools (lets call them web makers) is that, as you try to make more advanced stuff, you start running into limitations.</p>
<p>Still, they're very easy and fun to use, and it's awesome to see what you can make with them!</p>
<h1>Learning HTML.</h1>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aNfOePZ.png" alt="t1"></p>
<p>At some point in late 2017 or 2018, I started learning my very first bits of HTML!</p>
<p>I knew very little- just how to use paragraphs &lt;p&gt; and links &lt;a&gt; and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So I asked a friend of mine to help me out with my first website, and she agreed to help!</p>
<p>With her help, I put up a couple of very rudimentary sites and got them up on github pages!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jPQarKz.png" alt="t2"></p>
<p>Later, I reworked some of the elements on the home page and we ended up with the <a href="http://tirsod.com">tirsod.com</a> we know today.</p>
<p>It first went live about 6 years ago…</p>
<h1>tirsod.com</h1>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1sAWk2d.png" alt="t3"></p>
<p>And it has never changed since.</p>
<p>Well, no, I lied! :D</p>
<p>Under <a href="http://tirsod.com">tirsod.com</a> also lived a couple of pages:</p>
<p>/games, which showed games I made myself or helped on.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KYW7g7f.png" alt="tgames"></p>
<p>/bgm, which contained links to some of my albums, plus my SoundCloud.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SbJ6F0S.png" alt="tbgm"></p>
<p>And /art, which…never really happened? I was playing a lot with css animations and made a little slideshow that talked about the beauty of creating.</p>
<p>It was there for a bit, then became just a other link to my Instagram.</p>
<p>There were also other /slash pages that came later, but mainly they were just jokes or web game experiments.</p>
<h1>Stagnation</h1>
<hr>
<p>Well,</p>
<p><a href="http://tirsod.com">tirsod.com</a> pretty much remained the same since. From 2020 to 2024, there really were basically no changes.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, I would have been working on many other different things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Releasing Wave Rider</li>
<li>Releasing the Wave Rider soundtrack</li>
<li>Setting up a Spotify artist page</li>
<li>Making game prototypes</li>
<li>College, getting a job, working on music, etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, nothing too crazy on the web development side of things.</p>
<p>Most updates were being done on my Instagram or my Twitter, and I wasn't putting out any releases big enough to warrant making a new page on my site.</p>
<p>Still, I always thought about that site.</p>
<p>How weird it looked on mobile,</p>
<p>The many &lt;div&gt;s that enclosed its links…</p>
<p>How unwieldy the code would become if I added too many pages…</p>
<p>The slash/navbar that always only ever be an illusion.</p>
<p>My own lack of experience combined with how daunting it seemed to update this thing, made me not really wanna work on it.</p>
<p>That was until,</p>
<h1>School forced me to learn it</h1>
<hr>
<p>I started working on getting a degree in computer programming and, what do you know, they have you make HTML pages!</p>
<p>Well, now I at least knew how to write JavaScript and make some cool animations in css, so, shouldn't be that bad.</p>
<p>For the most part, it was easy peasy projects. Using canvas, flex boxes, and APIs was interesting. I learned how to use libraries, more advanced style rules &amp; how to connect my website to the web.</p>
<p>Essentially,</p>
<p>They had us make a website where you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saved a password,</li>
<li>Called the weather website,</li>
<li>Told them the password,</li>
<li>Asked them what the weather in Toronto was,</li>
<li>Then displayed it on screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice! If things stay this easy, I might just-</p>
<h1>The Final Project</h1>
<hr>
<p>…ace? it?</p>
<p>My school’s final project was to make a store website.</p>
<p>This is… easy? But there's a catch.</p>
<p>It is a group project, and nobody knows what to do. I mean, more than half of our team isn't even programmers— they do tech support!!!</p>
<p>Our goal was to make a website that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showed different types of clothing,</li>
<li>Let you categorize and sort them,</li>
<li>Let you click on them to see more details,</li>
<li>Would also show relevant items,</li>
<li>Lets you sign up for an account and sign into it,</li>
<li>Allows you to buy everything you want,</li>
<li>Adds it to your cart,</li>
<li>Lets you check out (no payment thankfully)</li>
<li>SAVES THAT</li>
<li>And ALSO let's you see it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short, our designated front end person made .html pages for EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF CLOTHING.</p>
<p>That is to say,</p>
<p>red-shirt.html, blue-shirt.html, blue-pants.html, cap.html, etc, etc…</p>
<p>All of these were done by copying and pasting one, then replacing all of the details manually, for each and every combination of items. Dozens of .html pages, all written manually.</p>
<p>Normally, you wouldn't want this, but the backend code was nowhere near done so there was no other way we'd get a grade.</p>
<p>Either way,</p>
<p>This was exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>In just 2 days,</p>
<p>— that is, two sessions of 12 hours, at the end of which I could feel the neurons on my brain frying up and short circuiting,</p>
<p>I figured it all out with some help from a friend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a server app. This would be playing the same role as the weather service.</li>
<li>Make a database. This will hold all of the different types of clothing, the users and their shopping carts.</li>
<li>Make the front end. I reduced all of the .html pages from dozens to only five: home, item, login, cart, and success.</li>
</ul>
<p>What the front end pages needed to do was contact the server.</p>
<p>Tell it, hey, server, what shirts do you have in stock?</p>
<p>The server checks the database, then says, “hey, we have these 👕 🎽 🩳 👖 “</p>
<p>Then the front pages would fill up the empty spaces with those exact same things. 👕 🎽 🩳 👖</p>
<h1>This will be important later.</h1>
<p>I wonder how many devs would stop here and say, ok, you've got a full portfolio now! You’ve done front-end and back-end! Full-stack developer!</p>
<p>Well not so fast there, buddy.</p>
<p>I may have graduated, but if you didn't notice, my school left out a huge gap in my curriculum. I'll show you what it is later.</p>
<p>We have to fast forward a bit, now.</p>
<h1>CARRD.</h1>
<hr>
<p>Well here we go.
Time is a circle and this proves it.</p>
<p>Shortly after starting my streaming journey, I met a lot of people that were using a <em>web maker</em> called carrd.</p>
<p>This one is just like the other ones, but instead of making full websites, you make cute web portfolios that look like presentation cards. Hence the name, carrd!</p>
<p>(I don't actually know if that's why carrd is named what it is.)</p>
<p>Everyone’s carrds were really cool! It was very inspiring to see just how much they could get away with within the limitations of the system.</p>
<p>Perhaps out of pure curiosity,
Or out of pure chaos,</p>
<p>I decided to make a carrd.</p>
<p>But mine? Mine wasn't gonna be like the other ones.
Mine was gonna be a full on WEBSITE.</p>
<p>(more details on why this is a bad idea later)</p>
<h1>LAYER 2</h1>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FGeSuc5.png" alt="l2"></p>
<p>For a bit there, this was actually “<a href="http://new.tirsod.com">new.tirsod.com</a>”.
You can't really host a carrd page inside of another page,</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p><a href="http://tirsod.com/">tirsod.com/</a> is an address that leads you to github pages. From there, all the slashes are essentially just folders within that github pages server.</p>
<p>Carrd is its own service- you can't meld the two. So either you take down <a href="http://tirsod.com">tirsod.com</a>, or you put it in a subdomain.</p>
<p><a href="http://new.tirsod.com">new.tirsod.com</a> IS that - it's nothing too crazy. The “new.” suffix is like specifying the area code to a phone number that otherwise would have looked the to be the same.</p>
<p>(XXX) - 333-6410
(123) - 333-6410</p>
<p>See? Two different phones. And those phones, have different files!</p>
<p>So my way of going about this was going to be:</p>
<p>1- I would keep the old (<a href="http://tirsod.com">tirsod.com</a>) website up, with layer2 (new.tirsod) as a complementary piece with lore.
2- I would update both whenever something new happened.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/otFfvxo.png" alt="l22"></p>
<p>There's a couple of problems with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>For starters, now you're maintaining two websites. That's double the work.</li>
<li>Carrd doesn't have pages! It has sections! That's like writing a whole book in one page! What if you need to shift the order around?</li>
<li>Carrd is also very limited- you can't program in your own JavaScript or CSS without paying more!</li>
<li>The Bandcamp music players don't work well! They don't show the full tracklist and won't display the art until you've clicked them!</li>
</ul>
<p>Soon, I grew tired of Layer 2, and I opted to make a new carrd. This time, closer to what everyone else was making.</p>
<p>Just a simpler look, that's all!</p>
<p>If I can make it easier to edit, that'd also be nice.</p>
<p>Oh. Wait. That's not a real thought, that's just a-</p>
<h1>Delusion</h1>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BOu9WaK.png" alt="delusion"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/izbfIQf.png" alt="delusion2"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kCrD0bH.png" alt="delusion3">
Delusion, or Layer3, is the final evolution of my carrd sites.</p>
<p>Using what I learned about how carrd works from making Layer2, I got to work on a bunch of different prototypes.</p>
<p>This site had many potential designs. One of them resembling a desktop operating system, with app icons that would link to every major release.</p>
<p>Eventually, it turned into its own thing.</p>
<p>A presentation card first, and a website second, though still too ambitious for its own good. The Delusion website (and for that matter, the dream layer’s website) was my attempt at not only designing the ultimate carrd site, but also at breaking the limits of what was possible with carrd, and I did it all with Iframes!</p>
<ul>
<li>Iframes linking to a music display to circumvent the bandcamp limitations</li>
<li>Iframes linking to a fictional forum page to have more control over the HTML underneath</li>
<li>Iframes linking to an API, hosted on blog.tirsod.com, that would show if I'm live on twitch</li>
<li>Wait a second—</li>
</ul>
<p>blog.tirsod.com???</p>
<h1>blog.tirsod.com</h1>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YGu6MDe.png" alt="blog">
This was a mistake, but hindsight is 20/20!
(I didn't know about static site generators yet. That's what the curriculum gap was.)</p>
<p>This is where the house of cards kind of starts falling for me… house of carrds??? 🃏
Sometime in December of 2024, I decided that I would start working on my blog… but it couldn't be any traditional blog. I didn't want to use blogger or medium.
This had to be custom built, and it had to feel… mysterious. Like you were scouring through files in a computer that wasn't yours.</p>
<p>I look through a couple of options, but in the end, I settle for recalling my history, and make a server instead.</p>
<h1>Making a server instead</h1>
<hr>
<p>Just like I did with the school project, I finalize both a backend and a frontend:</p>
<p>The frontend is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A singular .html page, with a sidebar and a box that would be filled with blog entries and content.</li>
<li>Accompanying .css (style sheets, fonts, colors, animations)</li>
<li>The JavaScript code that connects this to the backend and fills those fields up with information</li>
</ul>
<p>The backend is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A node.js app, that listens for GET requests (websites trying to get information from the server) and returns the right blog posts.</li>
<li>A .sqlite database, just like the one I used for the school project</li>
<li>Railway, a service that hosts dynamic apps like this one I'm making.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it turns out,
Well.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2tqcFyQ.png" alt="node"></p>
<p>It worked.
I had a blog!
But there were a couple of caveats…</p>
<ul>
<li>This blog ran on Railway, which had a cool trial for a bit but becomes $5 a month afterwards</li>
<li>Sometimes, the Railway server just took too long to load. Sometimes, it wouldn't start at all! So, no blog!</li>
<li>All of the content had to be uploaded in plaintext— eventually, I edited it to take HTML code, but that means I now had to convert Markdown to HTML using some other tool in order to post…</li>
<li>The admin view was up online, which meant I needed to have a password check to be able to upload, delete, or edit posts. That meant logging in to Railway to see the logs for a code that was randomly generated every time the app launched…</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iIwaBRo.png" alt="blog edit"></p>
<p>It was cool, but it was also pretty tedious to work with. I wasn’t even aware that the blog went down with my trial period.
You can't help but ask why I'd even be bothered with this…</p>
<h1>Eight months later...</h1>
<h1>Then… an idea.</h1>
<hr>
<p>Every time I tried to share my website with somebody, something would come up.
It didn't display right on their phone, or the blog was down, or it was too confusing to navigate.</p>
<p>I <em>dreaded</em> working with carrd’s sections and the blog’s limitations were starting to annoy me.</p>
<p>But,
A new project came up.
What if I made a visual novel… what if it was… on my website?</p>
<p>How should I do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Make every page myself? Probably not… if I want to change something, I would have to go back and edit every page…</li>
<li>What if I made it with carrd? Well. That idea didn't last long.</li>
<li>So, how about a Unity web app? Would be cool, but overkill for a text reader… and bad on mobile.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HozSdUS.png" alt="real"></p>
<p>After making these prototypes, I finally settled on raw HTML pages. That would be the most flexible, fastest way to get the point across. No visual novel system. Just get to writing. Use css to make custom art and stuff. And it would also have some of that… retro charm I wanted.</p>
<p>But if I wanted to speed this up… I just needed to figure out a way to make a lot of HTML pages out of some type of data. And make them fast. I can make a template in HTML. Can I fill those with data without making a server?</p>
<h1>Static site generators</h1>
<hr>
<p>While looking for suggestions on how to make this web-based visual novel, I ran into the words “Static site generators”. I already knew about these, but I’d never used them before.</p>
<p>They didn’t teach this in school!</p>
<p>I looked up a couple of names… Hugo… 11ty… Jekyll… Wait- Jekyll! I recognize that name. That’s what <a href="https://exodrifter.space">exodrifter’s website</a> runs on, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>I’m all over the place looking up names and tutorials and documentation… I try out jekyll, I look through exo’s notes. I see that she uses Obsidian. OBSIDIAN- SOMEONE MENTIONED THIS! I was asking about note-taking apps to write my novel on because I wanted markdown like Notion, but faster! I check out the commits. I see the .md files and read into them. THERE. THERE’S HTML TAGS HERE. YOU CAN TYPE HTML INTO MARKDOWN FILES!!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LMN0h5m.png" alt="static"></p>
<p>THEN EVERYTHING FELL INTO PLACE.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your HTML template yourself,</li>
<li>Have a dedicated space that will be filled with content.</li>
<li>Write the contents in markdown using Obsidian, which saves all notes as .md files locally on your computer.</li>
<li>The static site generator converts that markdown into HTML tags, and inserts it into the dedicated space in the templates!</li>
</ul>
<p>Could this be it? Time to experiment.</p>
<p>My first move would be to port the blog’s contents over to a bunch of markdown pages, then generate the pages using 11ty — that way I won’t have to install ruby. Ported the whole thing, put it up on <a href="http://tirsod.com/blog">tirsod.com/blog</a>. COOL! It works, and I don’t have to worry about the node.js app anymore!</p>
<p>Then I looked at the rest of my website…</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JhtHgEa.png" alt="redesign">
…</p>
<p>Should…</p>
<p>Should I get rid of carrd…?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6nqZBZa.png" alt="hold the phone">
And then I got rid of it. Over the course of a week, I ported the contents of my newest carrd over to markdown pages. Made a brand new layout, optimized it for mobile, and DONE.</p>
<p>Brand new website. Fast! No more fiddling with carrd. The whole thing can be built entirely on my computer and I can test as much as I want without having to publish the changes. I don’t even need internet connection to work on it. All of the pages are built automatically from the template and, if I want, I can also imbue them with custom HTML code. And everything is more unified, so more pages can share code and- if they need to be edited- they're only a couple of clicks away.</p>
<h1>And it really should have been done like this from the very beginning.</h1>
<hr>
<p>But.</p>
<p>You live and you learn I suppose.</p>
<p>Static site generators are an invention of… the 90s. Probably. But. You know. How many things do you learn every day that have been there for eons but just never came up in conversation?</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://tirsod.com">tirsod.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I’ll start adding, like, cool star particles that follow your mouse and sound effects ‘n’ guest books and that cool stuff 90s kids did.</em> (see all that styling? those images? that is the new site working its magic!!)</p>
<p>And huge shoutouts to <a href="https://exodrifter.space">exodrifter</a> and their cool freakin website. Check their stuff out. Such a clean setup.</p>
<p>As for that visual novel…
Bit of a secret.
Can’t say much right now.
Gotta finish some other stuff first.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Moral of the story?
Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Don’t skip class.
Learn a new skill!</p>
