                <p>Well, that's that. A successful year full of achievements.</p>
<p>(Yes, the song I've been listening to all year was, in fact, my most played song.)</p>
<p>Now, don't get scared here, alright?
Stay with me.</p>
<p>2023's closing act had me losing my job, and one of my most prized possessions to a text-and-driver. What I thought would be a 2-month recovery from that mess turned into a whole year's worth of paperwork and pain.</p>
<p>I've tried meditating on it, but no place in the world is silent enough for the amount of internalization I have yet to do.</p>
<p>It was very frustrating. And it still is.</p>
<p>But the world doesn't really stop for you. It never really slows down. It just keeps on spinning.</p>
<p>And for the longest time, while the world did its thing. There I was. On my own. In the dark.</p>
<p>They call it rock bottom, right.
The lowest point of your life.
Up until that point, at least.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, I can hear the sea.
The deep hum of the water. The sands shifting beneath my weight. The fish swimming beyond my grasp.</p>
<p>It sounds relaxing, right?
It kind of is. Feels like it shouldn't be.
Because that wasn't how it felt at the time.</p>
<p>But you wanna know something fun?
Hitting rock bottom taught me a lot of things.</p>
<p>While I've become more anxious, I've also become more serene.
And while I don't always have the patience of an angel, I'm also getting better every day.</p>
<p>Because I've learned how much more connecting with people can add to your life.
And because I've seen how unexpectedly,
how quickly everything can change.</p>
<p>And I am now grateful for those boring, normal days, when I get to enjoy life, as I know it, again...</p>
<p>So,
you could say it's been better.
I think I've been better.</p>
<p>About those achievements,</p>
<p>I'm still here.
That's a pretty good one as it is.
You are, too. Pat yourself on the back!</p>
<p>80-something streams, 20-ish songs, 50 drawings, does any of it matter?</p>
<p>Sort of,</p>
<p>The numbers alone really don't,
but the proof that I exist is present in those works,
and the insatiable thirst for knowledge I've rediscovered is like nothing I've ever felt before.</p>
<p>Every time I sit down to hone my skills, I feel closer to the skies, where my imagination freely flies, and the clouds are empty music sheets for my lullabies.</p>
<p>The world has become my canvas, and my greatest achievement will be making use of it all.</p>
<p>Next up, success:</p>
<p>A couple hundred dollars, a thousand transactions. Employee of the month, straight As for days.
No, but really. Does any of that really matter?</p>
<p>It's not the mark of recognition that fills me with joy. That's nothing but a sheet of paper with a marking on the corner.</p>
<p>Is that how you'd measure success?
No,</p>
<p>It's knowing that I've accomplished my goals by putting everything I had into it,
It's understanding that I am my own masterpiece,
The culmination of all my hard work.</p>
<p>It's making it to the end of the day with a new story to tell.
It's seeing a loved one sport a smile on their face,
More so knowing you're the cause of their joy.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yeah? No. No, I am not okay.
Well, actually, I am.
Thanks for asking.
You see,</p>
<p>I am here seeing that I'm really everything that I've got.
I am here knowing that I'm the architect of my own life.
I am here realizing that this year will only be as good as I make it out to be.</p>
<p>And I don't want to walk into the new year accepting defeat,</p>
<p>Thinking that I'm destined to fail until a miracle strikes. That someone else will come here to save me. That simply speaking my resolutions is enough. That by telling others I'll somehow secure myself some good karma.</p>
<p>And I don't want that to be you, either.</p>
<p>Stop giving up. Stop doing that.
Stop putting yourself down.
Stop undermining yourself.</p>
<p>You're not just &quot;a guy&quot;.
You're not an idiot.
You're not a waste of time.</p>
<p>Come on,
Put some heart into it.</p>
<p>You're so much more than that.
It's almost impossible to put into words.</p>
<p>You're all that you've got.</p>
<p>Believe in yourself.</p>
<p>Start believing in yourself.</p>
<p>You got this.
You can do this.
You've done this before.
You can do so much more! You can achieve so much!
You can be a force of change in the world!
You're a being of thought! That can create so much!</p>
<p>You're capable.
You're truly amazing.</p>
<p>Tell yourself that.</p>
<p>And everything is gonna be fine.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'm sure there's an even deeper pit for me to fall into in the future.
After all,
I'm still young.</p>
<p>Am I ready for whatever life is gonna throw at me?</p>
<p>I'm not sure.</p>
<p>But I'm not gonna let that stop me.
I'm not gonna let fear stop me.</p>
<p>And when I get there, I'm gonna claw my way out once more.
And I'll come out the other end much stronger.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna be ready for when it happens.</p>
<p>And when you're done reading this,
I don't want you to come find me and say, &quot;I'm so sorry this happened to you&quot; and &quot;I hope your next year is better,&quot;</p>
<p>I want to hear you say,
&quot;I'm going to do my best.&quot;
&quot;I'm going to believe in myself.&quot;
&quot;I won't let fear stop me.&quot;
&quot;I can do it!!!&quot;</p>
<p>No,
I don't expect it to be easy.
No,
You don't have to be perfect.
No,
I won't shame you if you &quot;failed&quot;.
And no,
You don't have to meet any expectations.</p>
<p>So long as you try,
And you give it your best.</p>
<p>You'll be okay!</p>
<p>and yes, I'll be okay,
I'm giving it my best!</p>
<p>That's all.
From a human being to another human being,</p>
<p>Please,</p>
<p>Have yourself a happy new year.</p>
