          <p>The thought overflow I just experience could only be deemed as an emergency.</p>
<p>That’s the most dangerous part of doing any house chores without some type of noise playing in the background. My mind is way too active and I start to write these blog posts in my head- It’s too scary when I sit down on my desk to try and type one of these out but I’ll completely forget what it was about.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about this web development thing lately. And it’s weird. Because I can tell it is one of those distracting, non-conductive to my final goal, things that look and sound cool but don’t really add much to the experience things that I still believe will do some great good to me.</p>
<p>Short answer, it’s fun.</p>
<p>People that wanted the short answer, you can turn around. Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Long answer, this is a post about aesthetics.</p>
<p>I recommend you put some “cyberpunk ambient music” in the background right about now.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/4FhsjQ2xess">Here’s a link if you need one.</a>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Maybe this is that thing about “discovering myself” that I see a lot of people struggle with but I don’t really understand. That’s really cool. I finally get to be on the other end of the screen.</p>
<p>I’m trying to put these things together by looking at myself through a consistency-check lens. And I can’t say that I have figured it out quite yet. But I know that I’m getting closer to the answer I want.</p>
<p>This web development thing. It scratches an itch. Not because I’m making really useful interactive pieces of software, which scratch another, different itch, but rather because they are almost exclusively about self-expression.</p>
<p>When you make a website for yourself, whether it is a portfolio or a blog or some random compilation of junk that you thought was funny, there IS an almost obligatory, subconscious impulse to imbue that site with hints of your personality. It is that thing I talk about with my would-be-interviewer-in-the-future when I have those mock-talk-show-guest-moments 40 minutes deep into a shower, when I ponder what the closest thing to uploading your consciousness to the internet and preserving your essence would be without actually putting a chip in your brain.</p>
<p>It is mandatory, basically. Because how you style that site is almost representative of, not your brand, but what you perceive your brand to be. Your favorite color, your favorite type of music, the type of fonts you like. These are all things that surround you and tag along with you when you take a walk around the park. Some shirt you saw. A sign on the crossroads. A car that passed you by. A dog breed you haven’t seen in a while. Those likes and interests are not necessarily what makes you, YOU. But they ARE a large part of how other people perceive you. They are the first couple of things we talk about in conversation. “What type of music do you like?”, “Do you play games?”.</p>
<p>We’re discovering each other’s brands. Not in a “consumerist capitalistic marketing” way, but rather in a “signature, fingerprint of my soul” kind of way.</p>
<p>It really isn’t JUST a collection of links. It’s not a .txt file with your socials and your shop. Even for a linktree, which I avoid like the plague because they look to me like the most simple, cop-out, “gets the job done” kind of way to do this thing (to a person that tries to do everything the hardest way there is, POSSIBLY MAYBE EVEN), you get to pick the color, the size, the shape, the fonts, the backgrounds, the profile picture, what IS and ISN’T shown. What ORDER it’s shown in. What you BELIEVE to be the most important things. How you CATEGORIZE those things because of how you sort your interests by priority in your head.</p>
<p>Maybe music is the most important thing ever to you, and your website includes 5 different links to playlists you’ve personally CURATED, because that IS your definition of GOOD MUSIC that EVERYONE should be listening to.</p>
<p>And that is what the reader, innocent bystander that stumbles upon your DNS record, sees.</p>
<p>It is a wanted poster with your soul front and center on the picture frame.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m thinking about my own site in this way. And it seems hard to figure out what my aesthetic really is because it seems to me that I like many, many different things.</p>
<p>I’m a champion of the color blue. But the mixtures of black, white and red are appealing to me. The monochromes and the super posterized images of greens and yellows are insinuating beautiful visions of nature to me. When I can’t choose one, I just take them all, and I make an extravagant piece with every vibrant color I can remember all put into it. A total rave of chromaticism.</p>
<p>The static of TV’s are alluring. A light drizzling rain hitting the windshield in a car. The echoy footsteps of a dark, long hotel hallway. Flowers fluttering with butterflies in the wind of a vast, colorful plain. The imprints of buildings in the skies of pixelated cities. A single shooting star leaving a trail of pink in the dark.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>Makes.</p>
<p>Sense.</p>
<p>In the apparent uniformity of the modern world, the rejection of style, and this overt emphasis on practicality and consistency, it IS almost like the call of chaos. The defiance of an artist trying to swim against the flow of the rivers. Everyone is doing it. They’re calling back to their childhood years. The insanity of colors chosen by a kid with no concept of color theory, who just draws their heart’s intents with great intensity.</p>
<p>I don’t WANT this black on white boring newspaper article websites have turned into. I don’t want to be part of your minimalistic movement. I don’t want this monotone look that we pushed for in favor of easily digested products.</p>
<p>I want what we sacrificed BACK. I want to see it happen. I can SEE why that IS, TOO.</p>
<p>I can see why I am so “consistently inconsistent”. My interests are very broad. The stuff I live for changes so often. Not every season. Every WEEK. I want to learn so much more. I want to do so much more.</p>
<p>A single aesthetic is CLAUSTROPHOBIC to someone who does So many things, all at once.</p>
<p>I’m going to make a gigantic fucking mess.</p>
<p>And it’s gonna be incredible.</p>
<p>Whether it’s mobile compliant or not,</p>
<p>Whether it makes sense thematically or not,</p>
<p>Whether it has plot holes all over the place or not,</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Because it’s made of what I am made.</p>
<p>A crazy, multidisciplinary distillation of things deep and shallow, dark and bright, happy and sad, quiet and loud.</p>
<p>Getting lost IS part of the fun. Because there’s so much to explore when you’ve got no concept of WHERE TO GO.</p>
<p>What the fuck man.</p>
<p>Go learn HTML right now.</p>
<p>Make a website with the type of 90’s experimental rawness only a text editor and having Absolutely No Clue what you’re doing can provide you.</p>
<p>See where those happy little accidents lead you.</p>
<p>It’s so much fun to have so many things to do. So much to see. So much to learn.</p>
<p>I can’t help it.</p>
