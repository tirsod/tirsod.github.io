                <p>Perhaps…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Perhaps it wasn’t the greatest idea. Not that I would really know.</p>
<p>Before me, there’s a monitor. I stare at the blank page on my notes application. The page stares back at me.</p>
<p>It’s begging me to write up a new blog post.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy, man.” - I tell the empty page.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem to care. Unfazed. Typical of an inanimate object.</p>
<p>I can hear it talking back, however.</p>
<p>“It’s not the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Typing your thoughts into a keyboard,” - It says.</p>
<p>But I can’t deny it. I have to accept it. This thing is right. It’s mocking me, but it’s also right.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been lacking the drive. That pull from the ether that guides my hand towards that magical piece of paper where stories are born.</p>
<p>It’s been… like that… for a while now. It had picked back up, but it’s falling down.</p>
<p>At some point I thought it was the shape of my chair. Maybe the size of the notebook. Perhaps the app I write on. The decoration on my desk. The colors of the walls in my room.</p>
<p>But I could never figure it out.</p>
<p>Still haven’t. In case you’re wondering.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I spent around a week trying to figure out why those words were showing up in my head.</p>
<p>“I’m still figuring it out”. “I don’t quite get it.” “I can’t understand.”</p>
<p>I don’t even remember the exact choice of words. The order of the letters. The rhythm of the sentence.</p>
<p>I’d start thinking up a sentence starting with those words, but had no clue where I was going with it.</p>
<p>I knew I’d write a blog post about it. I knew how it would start, and how it would end. But I never wrote it down.</p>
<p>It’s gone now. I never wrote that blog post. But that sensation isn’t gone. It lingers. It eats away at my soul.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>One after another, a blog post is written in my head, I think about it for very long, then in the blink of an eye… it’s gone.</p>
<p>One after another, a project is born in my mind, I start working on it, then through the passage of time… It’s forgotten.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Friction is minimal, considering the short sequence of clicks and keystrokes that leads us there.</p>
<p>Me, my mind, my heart.</p>
<p>We’re floating through reality in an attempt to alter the world around us. We’re sliding on ice looking for even ground to step foot on.</p>
<p>But it seems futile. The ground might as well collapse from beneath us.</p>
<p>Getting out of bed is hard. The idea of work drives him mad. A laugh is hard to come by.</p>
<p>You’re swept away from your dreams, and realize just how far away everything is.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The paths have somehow converged into a 2-way split.</p>
<p>The winding roads you thought would take you to different places. They’re all here.</p>
<p>North. East. West. South. It didn’t matter. It is now “left” or “right”.</p>
<p>And surely, they’ll split again in the future. And then they’ll converge once again.</p>
<p>The question is,</p>
<p>Where do you want to go now?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The other day, while at work, I managed to make myself cry.</p>
<p>“The passage of time is constant” can be really comforting when you want something to be over with. But it can also bring a lot of pain into the heart.</p>
<p>How those voices I heard for so long are gone is beyond me. It’s impossible to get a grip of what reality has told me. I miss them dearly. But I don’t want that to slow me.</p>
<p>There’s things I can’t change. I can pretend they don’t control me. But it’s hard to deny the strings when you let them be the only thing you can see.</p>
<p>There’s nothing I can do to make time pass by faster. Not thinking about it might be the closest thing.</p>
<p>It’s about perception. Perceiving the time fly by.</p>
<p>But that requires… something. Something I don’t often have.</p>
<p>It’s something that comes by… subconsciously. Maybe not even that. Maybe just unconsciously. Maybe it just happens. Maybe it never happens.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>How many times can a thought begin with “how many times” and not have a purpose beyond that?</p>
<p>How long will it be until I can fit in my own mind?</p>
<p>How hard can it be to breathe easy one more time?</p>
<p>What possibly could I do to make that a reality of mine?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Maybe I do want to drive around in the dark of night. Maybe I do want to see the sunrise and its light.</p>
<p>Maybe I just want to disconnect from the web and never come back. Maybe I just need more time to work on those lines.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A couple of lines of code</p>
<p>A couple of lines in a blog.</p>
<p>A couple of lines in a song</p>
<p>A couple of lines from my lore.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>SEO, growth, follower counts, likes, engagement, impressions, live viewers, concurrent chatters…</p>
<p>Man.</p>
<p>If life had metrics like that, would we treat it like we do our online personas?</p>
<p>Hellos, good-byes, please and thank yous… Time spent with your loved ones, chats had with your friends, stories from your relatives… Songs shared with a random old man?</p>
<p>Would we take pride in those? Or would we hide them away from the public eye?</p>
<p>Would we try to maximize those things because we cared, or would we do it to show off those stats?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Maybe less really is more.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Maybe I need less of you.</p>
<p>Maybe you need less of me.</p>
<p>And that was what I heard.</p>
<p>That was what they said.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to believe them. But I can’t.</p>
<p>So I’ll figure out what those words really mean.</p>
<p>What those thoughts running in my head want to be.</p>
<p>What they want to transform into.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah. Nothing is ever really that easy.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ve got to put your mind to it.</p>
<p>Saying that is easy. Nobody had any doubt about that.</p>
<p>I believe in my message, yes. The problem is doing what I say.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Because it’s tiring to do what I say.</p>
<p>I’m tired of not being present in the day. I’m tired of reworking things time and time again.</p>
<p>I’m tired of forgetting about the things I want to make.</p>
<p>One after another,</p>
<p>a thought crosses my mind and vanishes as quickly as it came.</p>
<p>... -</p>
<p>I don’t want to spend any more time into this.</p>
<p>Because I have to get some sleep.</p>
<p>I don’t want to get any more sleep.</p>
<p>Because I have to put more time into this.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I gave up because I thought today would be a better day.</p>
<p>Today, I gave up because tomorrow I’ll have no time to spend.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>One after another,</p>
<p>The days would end before they could begin.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I want to experience a new form of change.</p>
<p>I want to reinvent myself. I want to see what’s there.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to see the look on my own face when “the four walls” around me finally break.</p>
<p>When my sense of self becomes free again.</p>
<p>When the chain is released, and I get to be that again.</p>
<p>When the fog is cleared, I will finally get to rest.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>No longer held back by myself.</p>
<p>No longer sabotaging my success.</p>
<p>No longer settling for less.</p>
<p>No longer accepting a miserable fate.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>One after another,</p>
<p>a barrier will crumble to bits.</p>
<p>One after another,</p>
<p>a dream with which to hold hands.</p>
<p>One after another,</p>
<p>a flower will bloom in the garden.</p>
<p>One after another,</p>
<p>a star in the sky to shine upon my path.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In my mind, I truly am alone,</p>
<p>but in keeping myself company, I’ve found comfort the likes of which I’ve never felt before.</p>
<p>Not with anyone.</p>
<p>Nobody that I know.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I talk to myself because I know I’m all I’ve got.</p>
<p>I understand myself, but at the same time I don’t.</p>
<p>That reflection in the mirror knows me better than my mom.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But I know that it will be alright.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>So long as we’re on the same page.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Not you and I.</p>
<p>I know you’re gonna be alright.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>My mind, my soul, my heart, and I.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Well, no. It still feels like a lie. But at least I’m honest. That is what I want, after all.</p>
<p>I can still feel time dragging me downwards. The weights are still on. That’s a shame.</p>
<p>My sincerest apologies if you don’t find me well.</p>
<p>I really am… trying my best.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I thought this exercise would be liberating, but alas.</p>
<p>The cycle continues.</p>
<p>It will most likely come to pass.</p>
<p>It’s not my first time living this life, after all.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>But man, these are some really hard shoes to fill.</p>
<p>I’ve got a headache.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I’ll see you when I see you.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
